###### 4. [1492. The kth Factor of n](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/1492.%20The%20kth%20Factor%20of%20n)

Given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

###### 5. [1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/1493.%20Longest%20Subarray%20of%201's%20After%20Deleting%20One%20Element)

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.
Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array.
Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

###### 6. [1496. Path Crossing](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/1496.%20Path%20Crossing)

Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
Return True if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you've previously visited. Return False otherwise.

###### 7. [1507. Reformat Date](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/1507.%20Reformat%20Date)

Given a date string in the form Day Month Year, where:
Day is in the set {"1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", ..., "30th", "31st"}.
Month is in the set {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"}.
Year is in the range [1900, 2100].
Convert the date string to the format YYYY-MM-DD, where:
YYYY denotes the 4 digit year.
MM denotes the 2 digit month.
DD denotes the 2 digit day.

###### 9. [13. Roman to Integer](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/13.%20Roman%20to%20Integer)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
