###### 4. [1492. The kth Factor of n](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/1492.%20The%20kth%20Factor%20of%20n)

Given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
