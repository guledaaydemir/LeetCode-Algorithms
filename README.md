Day is in the set {"1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", ..., "30th", "31st"}.
Month is in the set {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"}.
Year is in the range [1900, 2100].
Convert the date string to the format YYYY-MM-DD, where:
YYYY denotes the 4 digit year.
MM denotes the 2 digit month.
DD denotes the 2 digit day.

###### 9. [13. Roman to Integer](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/13.%20Roman%20to%20Integer)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

###### 10. [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/14.%20Longest%20Common%20Prefix)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

###### 11. [20. Valid Parentheses](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/20.%20Valid%20Parentheses)

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

###### 12. [66. Plus One](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/66.%20Plus%20One)

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

###### 13. [509. Fibonacci Number](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/509.%20Fibonacci%20Number)

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

###### 14. [223. Rectangle Area](https://github.com/guledaaydemir/LeetCode-Algorithms/tree/master/223.%20Rectangle%20Area)

Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.
The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).
