105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Example 2:
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
